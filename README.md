ASCII Art

"ASCII Art" project is a project that converts a normal image into an ASCII image. The ASCII is a sequence of characters that is used by computer machine. In other words, the image will be changed to the sequence of characters such as words, symbols, and numbers. 

To work this project, I used Python as a programming language. The big reason is Python has many libraries for image processing. For this project, I used Pillow from PIL (Python Imaging Library). It is able to read, display, rotate, and more. I will use other programming languages for this project in the near future.

I thank Mr. Robert Heaton for this project. Your website is very helpful to those who saw it, including me. Here is the link that I talked about: https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/
